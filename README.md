# Note
I didn't refactor the functions in these notebooks into OOP style. So if you want a clean class implementation, you can find in my contributions to [MLAlgorithms](https://github.com/rushter/MLAlgorithms/).
* [Gaussian Mixture](https://github.com/rushter/MLAlgorithms/blob/master/mla/gaussian_mixture.py)

# Dependency
Python 3 with **numpy, matplotlib and sklearn**.

Though I didn't test carefully, it should run well with Python 2 too.
